This application was developed so a barista (or any other customer service oriented position) would have a mobile POS (point of sale) machine.

Created in the hopes that if a store has a drive-through, one could use this application
while approaching vehicles and can take orders remotely in order to speed the process

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP with mySQL back-end
